# Mahishasura
a demo polymorphic remote access software with process hollowing,tor routing, encrypted communication and process migration.NOOTE:this is just for educational and demo puprosses to explain techniques 
Here's a breakdown of what each section does:

AES Encryption and Decryption:

encrypt(data) and decrypt(enc_data) functions use AES encryption (CBC mode) to encrypt and decrypt data. The secret key and initialization vector (IV) are hardcoded.
Polymorphic Payload Generation:

generate_polymorphic_payload() creates a payload that is obfuscated using different methods, such as base64 encoding or reversing the string.
Dynamic Code Execution:

execute_dynamic_code() generates and executes arbitrary code snippets. This is an example of code injection.
Process Hollowing:

process_hollowing() performs process hollowing by creating a new process in a suspended state and then injecting code into it. This is used to run malicious code within the context of another process.
Reflective DLL Injection:

reflective_dll_injection() loads a DLL into the process's memory and executes its entry point. This is used for code injection.
DNS Tunneling:

dns_tunneling(payload) sends data encoded in a DNS query to exfiltrate information or communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server via DNS.
Cloud Storage C2:

cloud_storage_c2(payload) uploads data to a cloud storage service for communication with a C2 server.
Browser Script Injection:

inject_browser_script() injects JavaScript into a web page using Selenium to steal cookies or other data.
Sandbox Escape:

sandbox_escape() attempts to escape a sandbox environment by displaying a message box.
UAC Bypass:

uac_bypass() tries to bypass User Account Control (UAC) to gain elevated privileges.
Disable Defenses:

disable_defenses() disables Windows Defender and the firewall.
Privilege Escalation:

privilege_escalation() tries to elevate privileges by starting a new process with elevated permissions.
Use LOLBAS:

use_lolbas() uses Living Off the Land Binaries and Scripts (LOLBAS) to execute shellcode.
Hook Browser:

hook_browser() is a placeholder for browser hooking, which is not implemented in this example.
Registry Persistence:

add_registry_persistence() adds a registry entry to ensure the malware runs on startup.
Process Migration:

migrate_process_periodically() periodically migrates the malware to a different process.
Shellcode Injection:

inject_shellcode(target_process_name) injects shellcode into a specified process.
Deploy Logic Bomb:

deploy_logic_bomb() appends a NOP sled to a file as an example of a logic bomb.
Network Propagation:

propagate_to_network() copies the malware to other devices on the network using SCP.
C2 Communication via Tor:

communicate_with_c2_via_tor(data, endpoint) sends data to a C2 server via Tor for anonymity.
Spread IoT Worm:

spread_iot_worm() attempts to spread to IoT devices using Bluetooth and sends a polymorphic payload.
Main Function:

The main() function orchestrates the execution of all the above activities.
This script demonstrates a wide range of techniques used by advanced malware, including process manipulation, code injection, encryption, and evasion tactics. It's designed to compromise a system, maintain persistence, escalate privileges, and communicate with external servers while evading detection.
